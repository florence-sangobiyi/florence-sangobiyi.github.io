        Life is like a bouquet of colours as you never really know what you get.
        However, I believe taking it as it comes is the best way to go about
        in order to live a life with little or no anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal in life is to improve accessibility to quality education
        especially in parts of Nigeria where they are educationally under priviledged.
        Also, I'm a strong advocate of womens/girls rights.
